When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository can be useful in many situations:
      - Working on a collaborative project
      - Having to work on a project from different locations (eg. home, office,
      client...)
      - Show a portfolio of projects we've worked on
      - etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For the same reasons that we want to be able to control when we commit 
    changes: More control over the content of our local repo, especially if
    the remote has been changed by other users.
