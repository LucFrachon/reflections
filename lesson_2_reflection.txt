What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repo tells git to start keeping track of any changes to the 
	tracked files in the directory. To that effect, git creates a hidden 
	directory named .git that stores all relevant information.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a "virtual" buffer zone that allows us to precisely 
    control which files will be included in the next commit. The working dir
    contains all files in the project. The repo is the same, except it also
    contains history information.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
